# Project Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and inclusive of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Being open to constructive feedback and suggestions.
- Showing empathy and kindness towards others.
- Being patient and understanding, especially with those who are new to the project.
- Focusing on resolving conflicts and disagreements constructively.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Any form of harassment, including but not limited to offensive comments, trolling, or personal attacks.
- Discrimination, derogatory language, or any behavior that perpetuates stereotypes.
- Intimidation or threats of any kind.
- Any form of unwanted attention, advances, or unsolicited messages.
- Publishing or distributing others' private information without permission.
- Any other conduct that would be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [email address]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
