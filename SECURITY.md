# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of our users and our system is a top priority. If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, we kindly ask you to inform us immediately. We will conduct an investigation and respond promptly to address the issue.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow the steps below:

1. Send an email to [email protected] describing the vulnerability in detail. Please include sufficient information to reproduce the issue if possible.

2. Do not disclose the vulnerability to others until it has been addressed and resolved by the project maintainers.

3. Allow a reasonable amount of time for the maintainers to respond to your report. We will make every effort to keep you informed of our progress.

4. Once the vulnerability has been addressed, we may acknowledge your contribution, if you agree, and include your name (unless you prefer to remain anonymous) in the list of individuals who have helped improve the security of our project.

We appreciate your help in making our project secure and protecting our users' information.

## Supported Versions

Currently, we only provide security updates for the latest stable release of the project. It is strongly recommended that you keep your project up to date with the latest version to benefit from the most recent security patches and bug fixes.

If you are using an older version that is no longer supported, we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version or consider implementing your own security measures.

## Security Measures

We take security seriously and strive to ensure the safety of our project. This includes following best practices for secure coding, conducting regular security reviews, and leveraging industry-standard security tools.

However, please note that no software is completely immune to security vulnerabilities. If you believe you have discovered a security issue, we appreciate your responsible disclosure and will work diligently to address it.

Thank you for your contribution to maintaining a secure environment for all users of our project.
